# restaurant-app
This app will help groups of people that go out to eat together to split and calculate the cost of their meals, before paying.  
It will recommend its users restaurants having into account their ratings of past experiences. <br>
Having a section where users can search restaurants by type of food, proximity, and other filters. <br>
It will also have a social aspect, with recommendations and achievements. <br>
I will also try to have a section with restaurant rankings, a list of recommendations based  on previous visited restaurants (using the app), <br>
and a menu to filter nearby restaurants by type, average price per person, google rating, and others users' ratings.
