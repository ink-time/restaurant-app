# restaurant-app
This app will help groups of people that go out to eat together to split and calculate the cost of their meals. 
It will have a social element with recommendations. 
It will also have a social aspect, with recommendations and achievements. 
I will also try to have a section with restaurant rankings, a list of recommendations based  on previous visited restaurants (using the app), and a menu to filter nearby restaurants by type, average price per person, google rating, and others users' ratings.
